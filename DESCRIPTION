Description: This Package utilizes a generalized linear model(GLM) of
        the negative binomial family to characterize count data and
        allows for multi-factor design. NanoStrongDiff incorporate size
        factors, calculated from positive controls and housekeeping
        controls, and background level, obtained from negative
        controls, in the model framework so that all the normalization
        information provided by NanoString nCounter Analyzer is fully
        utilized.
